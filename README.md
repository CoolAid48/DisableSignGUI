### Toggle the sign text interface off and on! This is especially useful when using/building with a lot of signs, and hate having to close out of the popup every time you place a one!

## This mod features:
- **Toggle Keybind is `G` by default**
- **Inspired by [Masonion's NoSignGUI](https://modrinth.com/mod/nosigngui) mod, for versions <1.21.4**
- **Also works with Hanging Signs!**
