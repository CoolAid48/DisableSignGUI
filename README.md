## DisableSignGUI

This mod allows you to toggle the sign text interface off and on! This is especially useful when using/building with a lot of signs, and hate having to close out of the popup every time you place a one!

- Also works with Hanging Signs!
- Toggle Keybind is `G` by default
  
Inspired by [Masonion's NoSignGUI](https://modrinth.com/mod/nosigngui) mod, which you should use for versions <1.21.4
